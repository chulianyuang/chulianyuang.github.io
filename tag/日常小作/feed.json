            "content_html": "<h1 id=\"my-dream-job\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#my-dream-job\">#</a> My dream job</h1>\n<p><strong>In fact, my dream job should be to have no job and I can take my partner and my family to travel around the world every day enjoying the beauty of nature and eating all kinds of food. But I know this is unrealistic. Therefore, my dream job become creating an Internet company. Only when I have enough strength can I play at will. I thing dream is a little divorced from reality and can not leave reality. It feels just like science fiction. As a boy, I must have ambition. I want to build an Internet company stronger than Google  which is my dream job. I know it’s almost impossible, but maybe!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My company job in the Internet company is to maintain the normal operation of the virtual world. In my opinion, people in the future will completely will abandon mobile phones to play games. The mobile phone will return to its original function ,which is communication. People will swim in the virtual world through the equipment provided by our company, and 100% simulate the five senses of players. The main profit of our company will be the percentage of players trading in the virtual world.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>However, if I want to create an Internet company, I must have excellent computer technology. Not only do I need to learn the knowledge of my major, but I also need to master the knowledge of other computer majors. There is also equity knowledge, management knowledge and legal knowledge, so it is difficult to start a business. Another thing is that starting a business can’t do without capital. I don’t want to rely on my family more. So after graduation, I should work in a large Internet company for three or four years to complete my capital accumulation. This will also let me know how other companies operate and learn from experience. After all, starting a business is not a joke, and it is good to increase the success rate.</strong><br>\n<strong>In terms of how to work hard in college, I don’t really have a plan. But there are also some ideas. First of all, I need to find partners who share the same interests with me in some neighborhoods, so that I will not deviate from the direction when I live with them. After all, it’s not easy not to forget your original intention. What’s more, we need to learn online faster than the teachers teach, so that we can have more opportunities to participate in the competition than the students of the same class. Don’t put the opportunity in front of me at that time. I really didn’t seize it because I didn’t learn enough knowledge.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"我梦想中的工作\"><a class=\"markdownIt-Anchor\" href=\"#我梦想中的工作\">#</a> 我梦想中的工作</h1>\n<p>其实在我看来我梦想中的工作应该是没有工作，每天带着我的伴侣和我的家人去世界各地游玩，领略自然的美和吃遍各地美食，但我知道这不现实。因此，我梦想中的工作就变成了开一家互联网公司，只有我有足够实力的时候我才能随心所欲的去玩。这里说的是梦想，也就是说有点脱离现实的，又不能离开现实，感觉跟科幻小说一样。那我作为一个男生不妨野心大点，我要创建一家比谷歌还要强的互联网公司。我知道这几乎不可能，但也许呢！</p>\n<p>我的互联网公司主要职务是维护虚拟世界的正常运行。在我看来，未来的人们将彻底抛弃手机玩游戏。手机将回归它原本的功能，也就是只有通讯功能。人们将通过我公司提供的设备身临其境的在虚拟世界中畅游，百分百的模拟玩家的五感。我公司的主要盈利将是玩家在虚拟世界中交易的抽成。</p>\n<p>不过想要创建互联网公司，作为未来老板的我必须具备高超的电脑技术。不单是我这个专业的知识要学，其它计算机专业的知识我也要掌握。还有就是股权知识，管理知识，法律知识也要略懂，所以创业很难。还有就是创业离不开资金，我不想过多依靠家里，所以毕业后我应该会去大的互联网公司工作三四年完成我的资本积累，这样也可以让我熟悉一些别人的公司是怎么运作的，学习经验，毕竟创业可不是儿戏，能增加一丝成功率都是好的。</p>\n<p>要说在大学应该如何为之努力的话，我其实还不是很有计划。但也有想法，首先我要找到与我在一些邻域志同道合的伙伴，与之共处才不会让自己偏离了方向。毕竟不忘初心谈何容易。还有的就是要在网上学习的比老师教的要快，这样才能比同届的同学多一些参加比赛实践的机会。别到时候机会摆在我面前，我确因为知识没有学习到位没有抓住它。</p>\n",
