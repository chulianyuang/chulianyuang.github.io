            "content_html": "<hr>\n<p>*<em>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Motherboard:<em>At least two companies in British Columbia, Canada, say they’ve received exemptions from the federal government <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmljZS5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWNsZS85M2s5NTcvY2FuYWRhLWJjLWNvY2FpbmUtc2FsZQ==\">allowing them to produce and distribute cocaine, heroin, MDMA, or magic mushrooms</span>. But it’s not clear under what circumstances the companies will be able to sell the drugs, and B.C. Premier David Eby said he was “astonished” to hear the announcement. On Thursday, Sunshine Earth Labs, a psychedelics manufacturer <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c3dpcmUuY2EvbmV3cy1yZWxlYXNlcy9zdW5zaGluZS1lYXJ0aC1sYWJzLWx0ZC1wcm92aWRlcy1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtdXBkYXRlLTg0OTEzMjE1Ny5odG1s\">announced</span> that Health Canada, a federal government agency, is allowing the company to legally produce and distribute the coca leaf and cocaine; MDMA; opium; morphine, heroin and psilocybin, the active ingredient in shrooms. The company said it plans to “bring a safer supply of drugs to the global market.”</em></em></p>\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, cannabis extractions company Adastra <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9hZGFzdHJhaG9sZGluZ3MuY2EvYWRhc3RyYS1sYWJzLXJlY2VpdmVzLWhlYWx0aC1jYW5hZGEtYXBwcm92YWwtZm9yLXRoZS1hbWVuZG1lbnQtdG8taW5jbHVkZS1jb2NhaW5lLXVuZGVyLWl0cy1jb250cm9sbGVkLXN1YnN0YW5jZXMtZGVhbGVycy1saWNlbnNlLw==\">announced</span> it’s now legally allowed to both produce and distribute psilocybin and cocaine. In a statement to VICE News, Health Canada said Adastra is licensed to produce the drugs for scientific and medical purposes but cannot sell products to the general public. “They are only permitted for sale to other licence holders who have cocaine listed on their licence, pharmacists, practitioners, hospitals, or the holder of a section 56(1) exemption for research purposes,” the agency said.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Both companies claim they received amendments under Health Canada’s Dealer’s Licenses, which grant manufacturers, doctors, and researchers exemptions to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, allowing them to legally possess and make banned drugs. In a news conference, Eby said the licenses were granted without consultation from the province. “It is not part of our provincial plan,” he said, noting that he would be following up with Health Canada about the announcements. Adastra said it’s license allows it to &quot;interact with up to 250 grams of cocaine and to import coca leaves to manufacture and synthesize the substance.&quot;</strong></p>\n<img data-src=\"C:/Users/luo66/Pictures/Saved Pictures/9da590c366030c8837213120526a94f.jpg\" alt=\"小孩\" style=\"zoom:25%;\" />\n",

My daughter wanted a horse .My husband wanted property .My son wanted a dirt bike. I wanted our family to be more self-sufficient.</p>\n<p>None of us felt that this could be accomplished where we were living and we all agreed that a move to the country would be great for everyone .</p>\n<p>Before long we set about looking for a home in Yucca , Arizona , a very small town of less than 1000 people . It was while I scanning listings from our real estate agent that I first learned of it . There was a home for sale there on 40 acres . When I called to inquire about the property,I was informed that there was no electricity available in the area . What ? No electricity ? I almost dismissed the idea immediately.</p>\n<p>The property was off the grid . It was not connected whatsoever to any utilities -power , water or sewer . Power was supplied by a wind turbine and solar panels . Water had to hauled in and stored in two tanks located on the property. Forty acres would give us plenty of room for all of our animals and give my husband and sun space to ride their ATVS . Beside , what better thing is there to become more self-sustainable ? After giving it some thought , we decided to put in an offer and move in on Thanksgiving Day.</p>\n",
