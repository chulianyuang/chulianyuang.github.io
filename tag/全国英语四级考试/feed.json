My daughter wanted a horse .My husband wanted property .My son wanted a dirt bike. I wanted our family to be more self-sufficient.</p>\n<p>None of us felt that this could be accomplished where we were living and we all agreed that a move to the country would be great for everyone .</p>\n<p>Before long we set about looking for a home in Yucca , Arizona , a very small town of less than 1000 people . It was while I scanning listings from our real estate agent that I first learned of it . There was a home for sale there on 40 acres . When I called to inquire about the property,I was informed that there was no electricity available in the area . What ? No electricity ? I almost dismissed the idea immediately.</p>\n<p>The property was off the grid . It was not connected whatsoever to any utilities -power , water or sewer . Power was supplied by a wind turbine and solar panels . Water had to hauled in and stored in two tanks located on the property. Forty acres would give us plenty of room for all of our animals and give my husband and sun space to ride their ATVS . Beside , what better thing is there to become more self-sustainable ? After giving it some thought , we decided to put in an offer and move in on Thanksgiving Day.</p>\n",
